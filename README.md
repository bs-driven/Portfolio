## Motivation
with this i wanted to show a bit of myself to whom ever takes a look.I want to display the skills i haave acquired so far in HTML and CSS. I have made this page in order to describe myself and to create a profile page that can be looked up by virtually anyone. As i Learn more I intend to add more to this page and make it display my talent as it grows.

## Problems
A few problems I ran into were at figureing out to target specific elements in the HTML, I couldn't get the pictures on this page to show up at a point. I didn't have it going to the right path. I also at first didn't create a folder to store pictures.

## What I learned
I learned using the id is how i target a element on the page when something else is clicked. I learned that i needed to adda folder with the pictures in it that I intend to use more so for personal pictures the ones I was able to pull from the internet are a different story.

## Standout 
Well I'm not a person who's too confident just yet so I don't think I have a unique experience to give anyone just yet. I am giving a person insight into who I am what I striving to accomplish. HOpefully from this you'll be able to tell at least on the code side what are some of my intrest. The var names I choose were artist I like and anime I watch. I would have used more things related to me likes and prefrences but I didn't want to confuse anyone with a "<p>" class of Steelers and something else with the ID of Celtics.
