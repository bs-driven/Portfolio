                A little about me I am 32 years old; born and rasied in Columbus,OH. I find describing myself to be a tricky question. I'm a bit of a over-thinker never to sure what to share and what not to. I'm completely new to the field I admit. I began down this road in order to change the outcome of my life in a manner of speaking. I'd say I have had the luxury to experience and witness many different routes a persons life can take. From those I haven't found myself content or willing to accept it as the only outcomes I'm personally stuck with. Working at a warehouse barely able to make ends meet; struggling to provide for my family; working a job with next to no chance of advancement; being stuck at a job that doesnt challenege me; these are things I personally fear. Without making a change I'm fearful that the outcome of my life may just become that so here I am.
                A young man ready to dedicate himself to learning new skills, who isn't afraid of long hours. I genuinely want to be able to do work I'm proud of and have skills that I can take with me anywhere I may go. Hopefully this gives you a bit of a insight into who I am. I apperciate you taking this time
