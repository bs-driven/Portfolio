                    A little about me I am 32 years old; born and rasied in Columbus,OH. I find describing myself to be a tricky question. I'm a bit of a over-thinker never to sure what to share and what not to. I'm completely new to the field I admit. I began down this road in order to change the outcome of my life in a manner of speaking. I'd say I have had the luxury to experience and witness many different routes a persons life can take. From those I haven't found myself content or willing to accept it as the only outcomes I'm personally stuck with. Working at a warehouse barely able to make ends meet; struggling to provide for my family; working a job with next to no chance of advancement; being stuck at a job that doesnt challenege me; these are things I personally fear. Without making a change I'm fearful that the outcome of my life may just become that so here I am.
                    A young man ready to dedicate himself to learning new skills, who isn't afraid of long hours. I genuinely want to be able to do work I'm proud of and have skills that I can take anywhere I may go. Hopefully this gives you a bit of a insight into who I am. I apperciate you taking this time.

                As I said in the about me section I am completly new to this field so my work history won't reflect anything special. I'm coming from working in a warehouse as a forklift driver. which I've done for a few years now. Before working as a forklift driver I was working as a insulation installer which I had done for a few years as well. I worked as fence installer as well which I will openly admit to anyone was the hardest work I have ever done in my life. The man I worked for was a sub-contractor and only worked on metal/aluminum and chainlink fences. I worked this job through a summer; pushing a portable genearator in a wheel-barrel is no easy task. nor is using post-diggers. I was even a bartender for little while. That can be fun I will admit but I don't think I was in the right enviorment nor at the right time. Maybe I'm being a little judgemental when I say this I apologize before hand but I dont think as a man I could make a living strictly off tips. Something to do as a second or third job sure.

                I also have made a link to my github on this page that shows the work that I've been up to lately; showing the code that I've wriiten for this page and others. Hopefully you'll be able to see my growth which may look a bit slow or maybe I'm being a bit to critcal on myself. All ask is for you to give me a chance I don't have a bacakground in this feild. Just what I've been able to learn and apply through out this bootcamp. I got this far and will continue to improve so in a manner of speaking there will be a return on your investment.
