                    A little about me I am 32 years old; born and rasied in Columbus,OH. I find describing myself to be a tricky question. I'm a bit of a over-thinker never to sure what to share and what not to. I'm completely new to the field I admit. I began down this road in order to change the outcome of my life in a manner of speaking. I'd say I have had the luxury to experience and witness many different routes a persons life can take. From those I haven't found myself content or willing to accept it as the only outcomes I'm personally stuck with. Working at a warehouse barely able to make ends meet; struggling to provide for my family; working a job with next to no chance of advancement; being stuck at a job that doesnt challenege me; these are things I personally fear. Without making a change I'm fearful that the outcome of my life may just become that so here I am.
                    A young man ready to dedicate himself to learning new skills, who isn't afraid of long hours. I genuinely want to be able to do work I'm proud of and have skills that I can take anywhere I may go. Hopefully this gives you a bit of a insight into who I am. I apperciate you taking this time.

                    As I said in the about me section I am completly new to this field so my work history won't reflect anything special. I'm coming from working in a warehouse as a forklift driver. which I've done for a few years now. Before working as a forklift driver I was working as a insulation installer which I had done for a few years as well. I worked as fence installer as well which I will openly admit to anyone was the hardest work I have ever done in my life. The man I worked for was a sub-contractor and only worked on metal/aluminum and chainlink fences. I worked this job through a summer; pushing a portable genearator in a wheel-barrel is no easy task. nor is using post-diggers. The hardest part i would say tho is having to break through underground rocks with a steel rod. depending on what type of rock you got determines how long that one hole will take. If it were slate rock you can break it by slammingnthe rod into the rock a few dozen times, If you happen to come acroos something like boulder best bet would be to find the edges of it to dig around it or you are going to need some power equipment. I was even a bartender for little while. That can be fun I will admit but I don't think I was in the right environment nor at the right time. Maybe I'm being a little judgemental when I say this I apologize before hand but I dont think as a man I could make a living strictly off tips. Something to do as a second or third job sure. But the way todays society is set I don't have the right features to draw in a crowd nor make them want to give me their money. Don't get me wrong if I can be proven wrong about this I'll gladly take the challenege on I just dont see it happening is all.

                    I also have included a link to my github on this page that shows the work that I've been up to lately; showing the code that I've wriiten for this page and a few others. Hopefully you'll be able to see my growth which may look a bit slow or maybe I'm being a bit overly critcal of myself. All I ask is for you to give me a chance. I've been able to learn so many new things and apply them through out this bootcamp. I've been introduced to HTML, worked with dtyling in CSS, continue to learn the vast functionalities of Javascript; and yet so much more awaits me in the coming months. I got this far and will continue to improve so in a manner of speaking there will be a return on your investment one that I will see come to light.
