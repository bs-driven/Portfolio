                    A little about me I am 31 years old; born and rasied in Columbus,OH. Describing myself is always kind of
                    tricky for me. It's diffcult to determine which qualities to point out, then I were to say I'm nothing speacial
                    would that be me coming off as trying to be humble. Well one thing can be said I think alot I almost live in my 
                    head at times. I would say I'm a quick learner; a very teachable person with a eagerness to go further. There is strong 
                    likelihood I will be judged on my past mistakes in life, and if you are person who believes in that saying "Your past 
                    doesn't define you." Then I ask you to keep that in mind when you look at me.

                <h3>Insight Into My Work History</h3>
                <p class="Celtics">
                    I'm currently working as a forklift driver. I've done this for a few years off on. I've also have been a fence installer. I'll admit to you it's on my list of jobs I dont want to ever do again.installing chainlink fences in the summer heat wheel-barreling a genearator. I'll pass on doing that again. I've also been a insulation installer for a few years. Now this job had its ups an down some it wasn't too bad while others I'd have to pass on too. Freezeing in the winter rushing back to truck to warm up. Then there were summers coming out of attic looking like you were in a wet T-shirt constest. Now imgaine your wet shirt an working with this grey(apologize i dont remember the techincal name) insulation...it ends-up coating your skin. I have also tried my hand at bartending; which was kind of fun a bit scary too. I had got my bartending licence right before COVID hit in 2020. So when bars started to open back up I went for it. I picked a bad time but I looked at as a away to get some experience.

                Even this a bit tricky to talk about do I line up a resume for you. It couldn't reflect 
                any thing in this field. I come from warehouse jobs, fencing, installing insulation, forklifts,
                I even have some practice as a bartender, a cook( it was fast food). I like to look at it as I have experienced
                different jobs and came to one unanimous decison about all them. I don't want to be elderly working these
                dead end jobs where I'm not valued. These jobs arent meant for me the life I envision for myself doesn't 
                include me barely being able to keep my head above water. Apoplogize for the slight rant. There's a chance you
                missed this but the very first picture on this page is actually a link to my  githbub account which has projects 
                I've worked on. hopefully this displays my growth and capabilites. You'll even be able to find this page in my github.

            <p>
                Now I hope you dont mind the idea of equivalent exchange. You know my name; while yours is still
                unknown to me. You have access to projects I've worked on. Know even a bit of my story a journey to this point.
                I'll even give you my email address if I can only know two things about you. Your name and email.
